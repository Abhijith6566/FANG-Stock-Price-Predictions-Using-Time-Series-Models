# **Testing for Stationarity**

#Stationarity is where the mean an variance of a time series is not dependent on time. When graphed, it looks like white noise. Due to several problems caused by modeling non-stationary time series, chiefly autocorrelation, you need to check if a time-series is stationary prior to modeling. If it is not stationary, you need to get it there through differencing.

#A glance at the graph above shows 4 time series that definitely look non-stationary. However, we need to formally test for it before proceeding.

#The plots of the Auto-Correlation Functions (ACFs) of the non-differenced variables show that stocks are definitely not stationary. The ACFs of the differenced variables look potentially stationary. This suggests each stock is integrated I(1). Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests can confirm this.

# **Granger Causality**

#Establishing causality in observational data is notoriously difficult. Granger causality is a lower bar. It simply says that if previous values of X can predict future values of y, then X Granger causes y. It is performed by estimating the regression of the lagged values of X on y and performing an F-test. If the p-value is small enough, you reject the null hypothesis that all the coefficients of the lagged values of X are 0. In plain English, small p-values say that the lagged Xs have predictive power on future y, with a corresponding level of confidence.

#The output below simply states that each of the FANG stocks has predictive power over the others. This means simultaneous modeling is a good approach.


# creates a list of the FANG closing share prices to be looped through
fang_list = list(Close.fb, Close.amzn, Close.nflx, Close.googl)
# creates a counter that will be used for removing the ith object from fang_list using it as an index
counter = 1
# loops through fang_list
for(i in fang_list){
  # creates a temporary list
  temp = fang_list
  # removes the closing share prices of the ith stock
  temp[[counter]] <- NULL
  # loops through temp, which is fang_list minus i
  for(j in temp){
    # performs a Granger Causality Test of i's ability to predict j
    print(grangertest(i, j, order = 30))
  }
  # increments the counter
  counter = counter + 1
}



# **Testing for Cointegration**

#Cointegration is a word I've thrown around several times. It simply means that there is a long-run relationship between at least 2 of our stocks. The test for cointegration is known as the Johansen test, named for the statistician/econometrician that developed it. It can be formulated in 2 ways, the Trace test and the Maximum Eigenvalue test, which have different hypotheses. The details are fairly technical, so the tl;dr version of it is if the rank, r, of the long-run relationship matrix is 0 or equal to the number of time series being tested, there is no cointegration and a different modeling technique is appropriate. If r is greater than 0 and less than the number of time series, then there are r cointegrative relationships.

#From the output below, we can be very sure that there is greater than 0 cointegrative relationships, but we can not be sure at any reasonable level of statistical significance that there is more than 1 cointegrative relationship. Thus, we will assume there is one cointegrated relationship between the FANG stocks.

# **Choosing the Number of Lags for the Model**

#To choose the number of lags to include in the final model, I took a small subset of my training data; the period starting from May 09, 2018 and going until the end of the year. That was the date that left 163 observations in the mini-testing data set, which was equal to the number of observations in the test data set. I then estimated the model with 1 to 30 lags on the mini-training data and then estimated the mini-testing data set with that model. I calculated the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for each stock and summed them up. I then selected the number of lags that minimized the summed MAPE of each stock. The number of lags minimizing the summed MAPE in this tuning data set is 5.

# **How Accurate is the Model?**

#When assessing model accuracy, it helps to have a baseline comparison. For classification, it could be the misclassification rate of always predicting the mode. For cross-sectional regression, it can be the average value of the dependent variable. For time series, I like to have my prediction be the value from the previous period of time. That means my baseline accuracy rating is the accuracy of saying the stock price tomorrow will be the stock price today.

#Doing this produces a baseline MAPE of 1.36% for Facebook, 1.20% for Amazon, 1.70% for Netflix, and 1.15% for Google. That's not too bad for a prediction method that doesn't rely on complicated statistical models. Can the VECM outperform this?
